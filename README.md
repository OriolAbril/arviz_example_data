# ArviZ `InferenceData` examples

This repository contains the code used to generate ArviZ InferenceData examples that are available with `arviz.load_arviz_data`. This serves both as extra information on the models in addition to the description printed by `arviz.list_datasets` and to ease updating these example whenever necessary.

Code should be added as an executable file, either `.py` or `.ipynb` in case an extended description was to be included too. The name of the file should be the same as the key passed to `load_arviz_data`
