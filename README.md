# ArviZ `InferenceData` examples

This repository contains the code used to generate ArviZ InferenceData examples that are available with `arviz.load_arviz_data`. This serves both as extra information on the models in addition to the description printed by `arviz.list_datasets` and to ease updating these example whenever necessary.
